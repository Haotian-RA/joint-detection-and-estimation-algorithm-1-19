\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In digital communication systems, information is commonly transmitted in time-multiplexed bursts.
Examples include time-slotted random access systems. Each active user transmits in-formation to the receiver
in the same frequency band and in non-overlapping time intervals~\cite{Falconer_95}. 
A fundamental prerequisite for successful coherent demodulation is that the receiver can
detect the beginning of the data stream and estimate accurately the phase and frequency offset of the carrier.
It is worth empha-sizing that time and carrier synchronization are coupled prob-lems, especially at low SNRs:
coherent methods for detecting the signal require accurate frequency and phase estimates 
whi-le data-aided frequency and phase estimation requires that the location of the training sequence is available.
Thus, joint signal detection and carrier synchronization algorithms play a vital role in any communication system.

Clearly, the signal acquisition problem has been considered widely. 
In the late 90's, Morelli and Mengali~\cite{Morelli_Mengali_98} presented a tutorial review
of the carrier synchronization field comparing such characteristics as estimation accuracy, range,
and compu-tational complexity of available techniques. The work by~\cite{kay_89,Fitz_94,Luise_Reggiannini_95}
is most related to results in this paper. For signal detection,
particularly, sequential detection process, most of the sequential detector
is built based on hypothesis testing~\cite{Ramakrishnan_10,Chiani_06,Liang_15}.
More-over, the lack of information happens commonly when build
likelihood ratio test (LRT). For example, the LRT in~\cite{Chiani_06} 
is built based on the distribution of data stream, which is unknown.
The LRT is then replaced by generalized likelihood ratio test.

In this paper, we propose a joint detection and estimation algorithm 
for the signal acquisition process and implement it on software-defined radio (SDR).
In particular, the detection algorithm operates sequentially for every incoming sample
and is built based on the estimates from the carrier synchronization.
Thus, a family of low-complexity and high-accuracy estimators is proposed for implementing
in sequential detection and coherent demodulation on SDR at very high sample rate.
