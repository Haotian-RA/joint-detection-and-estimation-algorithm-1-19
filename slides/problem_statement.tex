  \frametitle{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Protecting information in contested and congested wireless communication environments requires transmissions that are difficult to intercept or even detect (LPI/LPD). 
     \item Achieving robust protection against detection relies on signals with power spectral densities that are well below the noise floor. 
    % \item To recover the signals at low SNR, joint detection and carrier synchronization algorithms play a vital role in protected communication system. 
     \item At low SNR, the time and carrier synchronization are coupled problems:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item coherent methods for detecting signal require accurate carrier estimation, while
      \item data-aided carrier estimation requires the location of the training sequence.
     \end{itemize}
     \item In practice, the position of the embedded training sequence (preamble) should be searched sequentially.
     % explain using sliding window.

  \frametitle{Prior Work}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Some classical work on carrier synchronization assumes
        perfect time synchronization~\cite{Morelli_Mengali_98}. 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item  However, this is not reliable especially at low SNR.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Some  work on joint time and carrier synchronization
        problem shows good accuracy at low
        SNR~\cite{purushothaman_16,kim_17}.  
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Focus on frame synchronization instead of sequential detection, and 
        \item the complexity of the algorithm is relatively high.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Computational complexity is a major concern with the
        practical realization of a synchronization system discussed
        in~\cite{murin_16,wang_21}.
